# ESP32 Thermostat

This thermostat is designed to control DC fans or any other DC device that will be connected to it. It is designed and works properly with a standard 3D Printer <b>100kohm NTC thermistor</b>.


### How to build ?
The code can be found inside the <b>ESP32_Thermostat</b> directory and can be compiled using the Arduino IDE.


### Story - Why I build this...?
Most budget thermostats on the market are designed to control A/C power appliances and 
I've been having a hard time finding thermostats to use with the DC fans inside PCs and Racks.

I designed this thermostat based on the ESP32-DevKitC development boards, as they are one of the most economical, small footprint and super fast development boards with built-in wifi
